"""Cross-platform tests for the python-bootstrap example manifest.

Validates that deferred resolution works correctly when platform-
specific plugins are unavailable:

- `pim` requires the Windows `py` launcher
- `pyenv` requires the Unix `pyenv` CLI

When neither is available, a RUNTIME action should still appear in
the preview with `installer=None` (deferred), rather than being
silently dropped.

Additionally validates that PACKAGE actions are deferred (not dropped)
when no Python package installer (pip, uv) is on PATH — a situation
common on fresh Windows machines bootstrapped with pim, where only
the ``py`` launcher provides access to Python/pip.
