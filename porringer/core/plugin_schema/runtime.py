"""Protocols for runtime provider and consumer plugins.

Plugins that manage interpreter installations (e.g. pim, pyenv) implement
`RuntimeProvider` so the sync engine can resolve the filesystem path
to a managed interpreter.  Plugins that need a runtime (e.g. pip, uv, pipx)
implement `RuntimeConsumer` so the engine knows where to propagate
the resolved path.

The two-part protocol system keeps phasing logic entirely protocol-driven —
the sync engine never needs to match on backend-name strings to decide
which plugins provide or consume runtimes.

Runtime state is held externally in a :class:`RuntimeContext`, not on
plugin instances.  This keeps cached plugin objects stateless and
prevents mutation from leaking across execution boundaries.
