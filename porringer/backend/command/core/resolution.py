"""CLI command implementation for resolution.

Unified operation resolution for inspection and real execution.

Determines the correct operation (install, upgrade, or skip) for a
given action based on the sync strategy and current system state.
Both the inspection path and the real execution path delegate to
:func:`resolve_operation` so that strategy logic lives in one place.

Also hosts :func:`is_package_installed`, the shared presence-detection
helper used by resolution, inspection, and execution paths.
